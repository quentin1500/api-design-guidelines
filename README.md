> 🛠️ Main document: [`api-guideline.md`](./api-guideline.md)

## 🧭 Purpose

This [generic API guideline document](./api-guideline.md) is intended to serve as a reference for API design within the context of an API-producing company or program. To suit this context, the generic guideline must be adapted. Refer to the [Deployement section](#deployment).

These guidelines aim to:

- Harmonize API design across a generic ecosystem
- Improve API readability, maintainability, and interoperability
- Ensure compliance with REST and OpenAPI standards
- Centralize best practices for versioning, security, pagination, error handling, and more
- Be the base of different other task on API

## 📚 What's inside

The `api-guideline.md` document includes:

- General design principles (REST, KISS, API First, etc.)
- OpenAPI & metadata rules (title, version, contact, etc.)
- Security standards (JWT, scopes, tokens, permissions, etc.)
- Naming conventions for endpoints, query parameters, payloads
- URL structure, verb usage, `/me` endpoints, etc.
- Standardized data formats (dates, currencies, countries, etc.)
- Pagination, sorting, caching, compression
- API versioning and lifecycle management

It is all in human readable language (english).

## 🚀 Deployment

The [generic API guideline document](./api-guideline.md) must be adapted to fit its context.

Each iteration of the `🔀` emoji in the file indicates a choice or input to be made by the person(s) in charge of the API Design Authority. Some of those may go with comments that should be removed.

Some iteration may be closed by the following string `=== end of propositions ===`. It must be removed as well.
